# Contributing

- Try and complete something from TODO.md

- All contributions are completely welcome!

- I would highly reccommend using an extension like TODO tree to find TODOs in files. Only **major** issues/problems will be listed in TODO.md

- Write clean code! Use semantically meaningful naming, add comments, and most of all, prioritize readability.

- Be nice, but don't hesitate to correct someone on an issue!

## Extra Information

**_These are much less important!_** If you can't use these tools, don't worry about it.

- When writing code, please use the `black` formatter. If for some reason you can't use the formatter, please do your best to format the code in a similar manner.
